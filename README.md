# BMI-Calculator
This project is a BMI (Body Mass Index) Calculator built using Python. It allows users to enter their weight and height to calculate their BMI and determine their health category.

**How It Works**

The user enters their weight (kg) and height (m).The program calculates the BMI using the formula:
BMI = weight (kg)/ height (m) ** 2

The BMI value is categorized as:
- Underweight (BMI < 18.5)
- Normal weight (18.5 ≤ BMI < 24.9)
- Overweight (25 ≤ BMI < 29.9)
- Obese (BMI ≥ 30)
